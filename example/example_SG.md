# Example Style Guide English, USA (en-US)

## Formality and Tone

In English, the tone of Mozilla's language should be adaptable to anyone. From new users to season Mozillians, the tone should be approachable, welcoming, and inclusive.

Mozilla is fun and should delight the user in expected and unexpected ways. The level of formality should express a sense of familiarity and friendliness while maintaining a voice of authenticity.

In general, use the second person (`you`) to address the user in Firefox products. Firefox is a user agent, and this point of view reinforces the message that "Firefox works for you."

Avoid using the first person (`my`, `I`) as it can create confusion about who is being addressed.

In some projects (like Desktop, Android, IOS, Focus, and Fennec), the language will be direct as it belongs to a software string. This language should be maintained as direct, yet respectful, and remain casual as with all other projects. Casual language should never be used at the expense of sounding disrespectful, regardless of the project.

## Natural Expression

Translations should sound as natural as possible. Borrowed words should never be used (with the exception of branded names).

## Cultural References, Idioms, and Slang

When dealing with cultural references, idioms, and slang in English, references to American pop culture (music, movies), sports (basketball, baseball, football), sayings, and some proverbs will be generally recognized. If a cultural reference is difficult to express in English, use the meaning to find a good equivalent. Refer to sources and databases of common expressions to help find an adequate equivalent.
