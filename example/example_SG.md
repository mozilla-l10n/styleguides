# Example Style Guide English, USA (en-US)

This style guide provides instruction for translating to the American English locale. This style guide is to be used in coordination with the [General Mozilla L10n Style Guide](general_L10n_SG.md)

## Formality and tone

In English, the tone of Mozilla's language should be adaptable to anyone. From new users to season Mozillians, the tone should be approachable, welcoming, and inclusive.

Mozilla is fun and should delight the user in expected and unexpected ways. The level of formality should express a sense of familiarity and friendliness while maintaining a voice of authenticity.

In general, use the second person (`you`) to address the user in Firefox products. Firefox is a user agent, and this point of view reinforces the message that "Firefox works for you."

Avoid using the first person (`my`, `I`) as it can create confusion about who is being addressed.

In some projects (like Desktop, Android, IOS, Focus), the language will be direct as it belongs to a software string. This language should be maintained as direct, yet respectful, and remain casual as with all other projects. Casual language should never be used at the expense of sounding disrespectful, regardless of the project.

## Natural expression

Translations should sound as natural as possible. Borrowed words should never be used (with the exception of branded names).

## Cultural references, idioms, and slang

When dealing with cultural references, idioms, and slang in English, references to American pop culture (music, movies), sports (basketball, baseball, football), sayings, and some proverbs will be generally recognized. If a cultural reference is difficult to express in English, use the meaning to find a good equivalent. Refer to sources and databases of common expressions to help find an adequate equivalent.

### Firefox for desktop

Use title case for labels for items in the menu, navigation and section headings, page titles, and buttons.

Use sentence case for headlines, which are the more conversational titles and subtitles that appear in instructional text screens, tours and form pages,  and text links without terminal punctuation unless the phrase is a question or exclamation or if the link is embedded in running text. (Note, include the terminal punctuation in hyperlink if the entire phrase is linked, and do not include the terminal punctuation in the hyperlink if the link is within running text)

Use all caps for all buttons that contain text.

### Firefox for iOS and Focus
