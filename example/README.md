# New Style Guide Format (DRAFT)

This new style guide format is heavily based on the most recent MDN style guide.

Sections of the MDN style guide that are applicable to all locales have been moved to the Mozilla General Localization Style Guide. Sections that are adaptable to teams by locale are not present.

The Example Style Guide for en-US serves as a sample for teams to view when modeling their own locale style guides.

* [Example Style Guide (en-US)](example_SG.md)
