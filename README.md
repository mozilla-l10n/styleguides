# Styleguides

This repository is used to store styleguides for Mozilla communities. If you’re reading these pages on GitHub, a version with improved readability and search capabilities is available [here](https://mozilla-l10n.github.io/styleguides).

## Style Guides

All localization style guides and related documents are listed in [SUMMARY.md](SUMMARY.md). If you’re reading the GitBook [version with improved readability](https://mozilla-l10n.github.io/styleguides), a menu with the list is displayed on the left of the page.

## Updating the documentation

Simply open a pull request adding the new file or updating an existing document. Make sure to follow [these style guidelines](https://github.com/mozilla-l10n/documentation/blob/master/misc/documentation_styleguide.md), and note that all pull requests need to be reviewed before merging.

## GitBook

GitBook is built automatically via Travis, and changes pushed to the gh-pages branch.

If you want content to appear on Gitbook, it needs to be listed in [SUMMARY.md](SUMMARY.md).
