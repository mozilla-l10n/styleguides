# Style Guides

This repository is used to store style guides for Mozilla communities. All localization style guides and related documents are listed in [docs/SUMMARY.md](docs/SUMMARY.md).

If youâ€™re reading these pages on GitHub, a version with improved readability and search capabilities is available [here](https://mozilla-l10n.github.io/styleguides).

## Updating the documentation

Simply open a pull request adding the new file or updating an existing document. Make sure to follow [these style guidelines](https://github.com/mozilla-l10n/documentation/blob/master/misc/documentation_styleguide.md), and note that all pull requests need to be reviewed before merging. The instructions for creating new community style guides are part of the [guidelines for community style guides](docs/guidelines/styleguide_guidelines.md).

If you want content to appear on GitBook, it needs to be listed in [docs/SUMMARY.md](docs/SUMMARY.md).

## GitBook

A version with improved readibility and search is built automatically via Travis using GitBook. Updates are pushed to the `gh-pages` branch and available via GitHub Pages [here](https://mozilla-l10n.github.io/styleguides).

If you want to build the GitBook locally, [install GitBook](https://toolchain.gitbook.com/setup.html) and in the root of this repository run the following commands.

```
$ gitbook install
$ gitbook serve
```
