## Abbreviations

### Common Abbreviations 

You might need to abbreviate some words in the UI (mainly buttons or options names) due to lack of space. This can be done in the following ways: 

It should be noted that Bambara does not frequently use abbreviations and acronyms and consequently there are very few abbreviations and no acronyms found in Bambara. Bambara adopts the French version of some abbreviations e.g. measurement. 

The words in the glossary were translated so as to have the smallest possible designations.

Do not abbreviate such words as `and`, `or`, `something`, `someone`, or any other word that users might not recognize. If you have any doubt, spell out the word rather than using an abbreviation.

### Filename Extensions

Filename extensions and graphic formats referenced by filename extensions such as `BMP`, `GIF`, `HTML`, `PNG` and `TIFF` must not be translated. 

## Acronyms

The term acronym refers to words that are made up of the initial letters of the major parts of a compound term if they are pronounced as a new word. Some well-known examples of acronyms are `WYSIWYG` (What You See Is What You Get), `OLE` (Object Linking and Embedding), or `RAM` (Random Access Memory). .

## Localized Acronyms 

When acronyms are localized, which does not happen often, they take the gender of the first substantive. Example: 

* `PAO` 
* `CAO` 
* `SGBD` 

## Unlocalized Acronyms 

If an acronym must remain in English throughout a manual or other text, the first time it occurs, write its full name in Bambara in normal style followed in parentheses by the acronym and its full spelling in English in italics. 

**Example:** 

`kunnafoniw ka yɛrɛman yɛlɛman ka taa mansin wɛrɛw kɔnɔ (DDE, Dynamic Data Exchange)`
