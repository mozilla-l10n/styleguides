# Terminology

Here are a few existing term bases we approve of for software/internet terminology and definitions (though not limited to):

* Microsoft key terms and target languages  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/Language/en-US/Default.aspx">https://www.microsoft.com/Language/en-US/Default.aspx</a>
* Pootle's own term list: <a href="https://mozilla.locamotion.org/xx/terminology/essential.po">https://mozilla.locamotion.org/xx/terminology/essential.po</a> (replace *xx* with a locale code)

You should be consistent in the use of existing reliable appropriate term bases in your language.  These term bases could be developed and approved by the community, or leveraged from another party that adhere to national, international or local standards for software and internet terminology.  Avoid the following:

* Inconsistent use of terminology within the project
* Inconsistent use of terminology with term base
* Inconsistent use of terminology across all of your projects
* Using terminology from another subject matter (e.g., don't use medical terminology in Firefox).

## Developing new term bases

What is your community's process for identifying and creating a new termbase? Here are a few things to keep in mind:

* Avoid overly borrowing English expressions
* Referencing another language from the same language family may inspire you to come up with your own terms
* Consider the product target audience (age, level of literacy, education, social and economic status)
* Will you use loan words from another language or coin new terms in your language to maintain language purity? Is there government requirement or policy to encourage creating new terms for new concepts, or will loan words be sufficient to reach broader masses and expedite new technology adoption?
* If there are two acceptable scripts commonly used by the general public, what is the commonly used script on the web or government sites?  What is the script used by major web technology companies?
