# Non-translated and Loan Words

## Localized term vs. English term

The preferred language in the computer world is English. Therefore, a translator frequently has to decide whether to use the (correct, but obsolete) translation or simply the English word.

### Inflections

The examples below show how English loanwords inflect for number in.

|English example | Bambara examples |
| -------------- | ---------------- |
| Websites | siti wɛbu |
| Proxys | proxiw |

### Singular & Plural

In Bambara, when the letter `w` is placed at the end of a word, it marks the plural of the word and is pronounced `ou`.

| English | Bambara, singular | Bambara, plural | Signification |
| ------- | ----------------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| Tool | minɛn | minɛnw | Minein’ou |
| name | tɔgɔ | tɔgɔw | Togo’ou |

### Verbs and Verb Forms

The auxiliary `to be` and `to have` often translate the same word in Bambara language `bɛ`. The negative form of the auxiliary `bɛ` is the word `tɛ`.

In Bambara, the word `ye` can also be translated translation of auxiliary be and have.

Auxiliary `have` also often results in Bambara with the word `MA` in negative phrases. These various cases cited above should be taken into account by the translator.

## The use of French loans in the translation

Considering that the Bambara language is relatively weak in the field of new technology, and seeing as Mali is a Francophone country and that most of the new words in technology are adapted from French (and some uneducated people learning these terms will learn what’s spoken commonly every day, i.e. French), the use of French loanwoards is an acceptable thing. If the word has no meaning in Bambara, or if a Bambara neologism would mean a complicated translation that will not be understood by the majority of the people, French loan words should be used.

**Example:**

|English | French | Bambara |
| ------ | ------ | ------- |
| Internet | Internet | Ɛntɛrinɛti |
| computer | ordinateur | ɔridinatɛri |

**Note:** There are words which have several types of translation Bambara and in this case, the translator will select the translation most commonly used by the population.

**Example:**

|English | French | Bambara |
| ------ | ------ | ------- |
| calendar | calendrier | `kalandiriye / donjati` |
| telephone | téléphone | `telefɔni / nɛgɛjuru` |

Respect of Bambara orthography
The French words that end with `tion` or `xion` take `siyon` at the end should be adapted as follows.

**Example:**

|English | French | Bambara |
| ------ | ------ | ------- |
| connection | connexion | konɛkisiyon |
| geolocation | géolocalisation | jewolokalijasiyon |

The French words that end with `ier` take `iyɛ` at the end should be adapted as follows.

**Example:**

|English | French | Bambara |
| ------ | ------ | ------- |
| keypad | clavier | kilaviyɛ |
| integer | entier | anciyɛ |

**Note:** In Bambara, words that contain a <š> are better replaced it with `s` unless it forms a minimal pair. In this case we will use `sh`.
